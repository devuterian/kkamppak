# <Project Name> Inbox

This file is an ephemeral scratch disk for capture waiting to be triaged.

Rules:

- Keep it easy to append to from external capture, operator notes, or agent capture.
- Use it as a pressure valve for untriaged capture, not as a backlog or brainstorm graveyard.
- Group related raw source events into one meaningful inbox entry when possible.
- Triage meaningful capture packets or clusters, not every raw source event and not an entire external history.
- During daily review, route, research, plan, discard, or leave capture; do not produce a giant project digest.
- It is okay to report counts or clusters of held, noisy, stale, or discarded items without summarizing every item.
- Do not update truth docs directly from inbox. Route through the orchestrator or an operator-approved decision.
- Remove entries once they are reflected into durable repo artifacts.
- Keep the stable `IBX-*` id even after the inbox entry itself is later deleted.
- Do not treat this file as durable truth.

## Purge Rule

Once an item has been reflected into `SPEC.md`, `STATUS.md`, `PLANS.md`, `research/`, `records/decisions/`, `records/agent-worklogs/`, `upstream-intake/`, or a deliberate discard/hold note, remove the inbox entry.
